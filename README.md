## Introduction

## Data Understanding
[Download dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices)
- CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: weighted distances to ﬁve Boston employment centers
- RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000
- PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 
- B: 1000(Bk−0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
    - Shows non-linear formula, when the higher difference from (Bk−0.63) results higher B.
    - In intuitive way, not all blacks are from the lower class, so the larger black population also indicates a more comfortable place for black people from the upper class when racial issues matter in society.
- LSTAT: \%lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
